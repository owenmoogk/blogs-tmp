## Altium Designer, New Project Ideas, and Internet Classics

This week, I’ve been spending a lot of time working in Altium Designer. With my co-worker, we’ve been designing a new PCB to be completely modular and expandable for years of future company design and progress. It’s pretty fun work, and nothing makes you feel nerdier than looking at a screen full of PCB traces.

It’s a bit of a different journey than learning to code, or CAD using SolidWorks, because there are much fewer resources online to learn from, and it’s a lot of trial and error. However, I’m quite thankful for my Dad who recently did a schematic review for us, and gave *lots* of helpful feedback, before we ordered from a PCB manufacturer.

Besides work this week, I’ve explored a few new content creators on the internet, and been reminded of some classics from years ago as well.

[A map for my inner child](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKEkBgPU-1M) by Jordan Studdard is an awesome decorative project that has interactive lighting on important/notable landmarks in NYC. Drawing from this idea, I’d love to make something similar with a world map, to document all of the places I’ve visited. On another note, Jordan also has a great video where he [builds a new studio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwphS4GTHYQ). It’s a bit cluttered for my liking, but I love the different work spaces to be in different mindsets, and how everything is a metaphor for his working process. I’m already starting to brainstorm cool workshop ideas for my first house.

Lastly, I have a few classics I’ve enjoyed that can’t go unnoted. First, the Muppets:

* [Mahna Mahna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTXyXuqfBLA)

* [The Martians Discover a Telephone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTc3PsW5ghQ)

* [Popcorn, by the Swedish Chef](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7UmUX68KtE)

And last but not least: [Bike Lanes by Casey Neistat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzE-IMaegzQ)

All the best,
Owen
