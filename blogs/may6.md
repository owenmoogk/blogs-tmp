## DNA Games, Marble Clocks, and a Frisbee Missile

This week, I’ve been fairly busy getting back and ready for school, but there’s still been quite a few interesting things I’ve come across.

First, [Steve Mould](https://www.youtube.com/@SteveMould) makes amazing YouTube videos. In his video about [playing tic-tac-toe against DNA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgPdRKqcRTE), I was amazed by the DNA technology, where DNA reactions could be used to ‘program’ logic gates such as NOT, AND, and OR. I’m not smart enough to know how it’s really applicable, but it’s incredible how we have the technology to do this. I also don’t really know how it scales to larger ‘programs’ (if you will), but there were tens of gates in these solutions that all seemed to perform well. All in all, a really amazing bit of technology and science.

Steve also has a video about [how a grasshopper’s leg works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUUW6SYl_ak), which reminded me of Veratasium’s [video about jumping robots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daaDuC1kbds). Both discuss interesting energy storage techniques in animals, and how most animals aren’t inherently good at it. It’s the best fundamental reason I’ve heard for why tools are so useful (and almost necessary).

Lastly, [Steve and ElectroBoom have a good science debate about a Chain Fountain](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcqX4UMXNKEdNBKABT3ZF6Fvu5Jkq3OxB). This is interesting not so much about the actual physics, but rather the different communication techniques they use. I found I was on ElectroBooms’ side very clearly at the start as he had a much more compelling argument, however later it seemed clear he was incorrect. It reminded me of [Veratasium’s Wind Machine wager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCsgoLc_fzI), which is also a great teacher for science communication.

Ivan Miranda has a video series on building a marble clock that shows seconds, and in this most recent video he [built a marble sorting machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMEaQmn1iP4). This is the sort of thing that sounds very simple, and it’s a tool being used (not the final product). However, this encapsulates everything about the engineering design process, iterating on the outcome for better results. In the end, it looks like something that should be on an assembly line, not a tool for a hobbyist.

Lastly, Stuff Made Here always makes crazy awesome builds, and [this Disc Golf machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9rClZrbnrQ) is no exception. He also has some great storytelling and humor, which is why he is one of the best makers on the internet to watch (in my opinion).

He’s also made an [Automatic Pool Cue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsTTXYxydOE), and [Explosive Bat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Puo6Vgcbxps&t=1311s), both worth checking out.

Phew, that was a lot of links! One more: [If your Aunt had balls, she’d be your Uncle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_O5YHX4urE) (I’m being ‘sherioush’!).

Cheers,
Owen
