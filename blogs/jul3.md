## A Fireworks Show, a Rabbit, a Jays Win, and Graffiti Alley

This week... A blog a bit more personal! I’ve been super busy getting together with friends, now that midterms are over, and have been listening to some new music!

Zach Bryan is a folk artist (some would argue country, I would disagree) who has some really emotional slower songs. Maybe it’s because folk music isn’t that popular (at least like his), so it’s a nice switch from the regular country. Some I like:

* [Spotless](https://open.spotify.com/track/0HEytGQM3bG1vKxER7IgVK?si=afbe4850e0ec4860)

* [Heavy Eyes](https://open.spotify.com/track/2gJj6WtAxXjApMs3PXsCeX?si=8f36b0681cd84c8a)

For Canada Day this year, I went up to Orillia for a fireworks show. A few friends were running the show, so I got a front seat to how it worked. I had never known how a show was orchestrated, and it turned out to be a bit different than I expected. For a show that’s quite expensive, I expected almost full automation, however there are a lot of safety issues that come with it. In short, someone had to have a stopwatch and call out lighting times, and then my friend would light racks with a flare, one at a time. It makes sense how this is safer, as it can be stopped if there are issues, and will always have human intervention. As scary as it would be, it sounds like a fun job!

While I was up near Toronto this weekend, I also stopped in Graffiti Alley, which was really neat! It immediately reminded me of [Rick Mercer’s rants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHPDqMGm2QQ), in his comedy shows. I’ve often been opposed to ‘city life’, just as a personal preference. Having lived out in a smaller town in Alberta, I found the lifestyle there much more peaceful and enjoyable than in a big city. However, walking around Toronto and seeing the nightlife makes me a bit more empathetic as to why people want to be there. The art is amazing, and Graffiti Alley was definitely my highlight.

Sometimes, I feel an animal doesn’t deserve to be called by a human pronoun… My friend has a bunny called Fattoush, and ‘it’ fits right into this category:

First off… this bunny is FAT. He’s about the size of two or three rabbits that I usually see out in the neighborhood. Probably because he eats drywall. Anyways, he got to ride in my car yesterday, and using his head as a pretend stickshift is quite nice, it’s very soft and playful. I hope to introduce him to a dog one day, where he may meet his final fate…

And, I finally made it out to a Jays game where they won! I’ve been to 7 or 8 games over the last few years, and they’ve lost every single time. I went yesterday without high hopes, but they pulled it off! As much as I was looking forward to making *more* jokes about how they don’t have any good offense, I really should be happy with a 7–6 win over the Astros. And, I love a good ballpark skyline:

Lastly, I still watch The Office a bit, and couldn’t help laughing at [Dwight’s expensive museum intimidation](https://www.tiktok.com/@dundermifflingifs/video/7203765400364928299?lang=en) (strong language).

All the best,
