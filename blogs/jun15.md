## Coding adventures, Intense CGI, and how Structural Engineering can go wrong.

Hey! I’ve been pretty busy this week with midterms, but have still happened to find lots of time to play some water polo, go golfing, and find some new bits on the internet!

First off, a song that I’m enjoying this week is [jealousy, jealousy by Olivia Rodrigo](https://open.spotify.com/track/0MMyJUC3WNnFS1lit5pTjk?si=2854225e532c43bf). Normally I’m not a big fan of songs of this subject matter, but she does an amazing job of building tension/suspense without just increasing the volume and layers of instruments. She plays some sound effects at interesting places, which almost always is a turn-off for me, but it goes with the vibe of the song perfectly. Also, the bassline goes hard.

[Coding Adventures by Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0ehjAfLFsp1PGaatzAwo0uK) is an incredible series about trying to simulate/code some real-world phenomena while learning about proper program structure and design. Recently, he [optimized a ray-tracing engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1H4zIiCOaI), but in the past, he's hosted a [mini chess-bot tournament](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne40a5LkK6A) and [created a logic engine capable of building a computing machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZwneRb-zqA&t=2s).

His videos are the perfect mix of informative, educational and entertaining (he’s always making something interesting), and can make the often overlooked side of software development (optimizing and performance) quite interesting. You can tell there’s a lot of effort put into the videos, and it goes a long way.

I also watched [an interesting analysis of a steeple collapse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfuUmU2wS2o) this week, where Mike Bell does a simulation and analysis of a structure failure. The most damning part, at least to me, was when an engineer who did an analysis found structural issues, and the committee decided not to act upon them. It was built in a different time, when safety and regulation weren’t as prevalent, however, it shows the importance of regular inspections and upkeep to prevent a catastrophe.

[GRAYMATTER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sibCmyoTkss) is a short film by Corridor, which is entertaining in and of itself, but the [behind-the-scenes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaGcLhhhbDs) of how it was made is incredible. There’s a shot that uses ‘Gaussian splats’, which I don’t know enough about to discuss, but the fact that the whole shot is CGI is incredible. The technology in filmmaking is wild, much beyond what I would imagine, and makes incredible illusions like this possible in video.

Lastly, I’m preparing to go to Germany with, well… [EDM music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sVq18S82Bc)?

All the best!
