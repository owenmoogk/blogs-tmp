## Summer so far: Golf Scorekeeping, Water Polo, and a Gift for my Dad

This summer, I’ve already been super busy, and am really trying to make the most of my time back home (as after this, I’ll probably be out of the country for a year!).

First, I’ve been following a few ‘makers’ who do some art alongside the tech, and it’s really inspiring! Notable ones include [Jordan Studdard’s Map](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKEkBgPU-1M), [Scott Yu-Jan](https://www.youtube.com/@ScottYuJan/videos)’s whole channel.

Anyway, I was looking for a gift for my dad and found this on Etsy:

I thought this would be a great gift because Dad was an electrical/systems integration engineer at BlackBerry (then RIM) for almost 10 years. But, it was almost 300 dollars! So, I figured I’d try my hand at making it myself.

I went to the dollar store and got a frame, some white bristol board, and double-sided tape. I already had a few old BlackBerrys lying around, so I disassembled one in the school shop and fastened it to the frame. As an added touch, I found one of his old business cards and put it below the phone.

I’m pretty proud of the result, and I think he likes it (he says he’s going to put it up on his desk at work). It wasn’t super complicated to do, but I’ve wanted to get into more art for a while and was never sure what to make. All in all, I’m really happy with how it turned out!

I’ve been golfing plenty this summer as well! It’s really fun to get out on the course after class, and I’ve been playing enough that I’m not half bad at it! It feels really nice to get a few pars and hit drives 250 yards; that actually go straight!

Tangent: When I was little (~12 yo), I was obsessed with spreadsheets. I used them to keep track of the snow shoveling business that I ran with my brother, with built-in equations and everything (I was quite proud of it at that age)! Aside from the business, I also kept track of my golf scores in a spreadsheet!

However… I lost the spreadsheet. I don’t know how, I always take precautions when moving files and make constant backups, but I guess even digital files can be lost to time. I think it must have been in a folder that I didn’t back up and eventually deleted, before I started backing up machine images. I’m still indexing my whole computer and searching the drives on the off-chance of finding it, but I don’t have high hopes.

Long story short, I’m not planning on quitting golf anytime soon, so I’m starting a new spreadsheet! I’m keeping track of scores on different courses, and am going to follow the rules exactly when it comes to mulligans and penalty strokes. The hope: by the end of the year my scores are lower than they are now! Who knows, maybe I’ll post a follow-up blog!

Lastly, something I’d never thought I’d be saying: Innertube Waterpolo is SO MUCH FUN! I’m in an intermural league on Sunday nights, where we go and play at the University, and I’ve discovered I really miss competitive sports. It’s pretty low-key in terms of skill requirements, but is still great cardio and takes some solid effort. After the last game (we won!) I was breathing pretty heavily and could feel my quads for the next day or two! I’m hoping once I have a month or so without any health issues/injuries, to get into some more rec leagues for spikeball/tennis/volleyball!
