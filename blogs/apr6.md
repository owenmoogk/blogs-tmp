## Social Simulations, the Maple Syrup Heist, and why I’m mad at Microsoft.

This week, I’ve done some good reading, and had a bit of an annoyance with Microsoft, but first…

[Nicky Case](https://ncase.me/) is an online content creator, who has made lots of informative and interactive content discussing different social issues, in a light and form that I’ve never seen before. Their [projects](https://ncase.me/projects/) go in-depth into many issues but some of my favorites include:

* [Polygons](https://ncase.me/polygons/), an interactive game simulating some causes of segregation, and how a society can be discriminatory even when no individual is.

* [Neurons](https://ncase.me/neurons/), a simulation to show how habits and anxiety is handled in the brain, and how exposure therapy can help

* [We Become What We Behold](https://ncase.itch.io/wbwwb), an illustration of how negative media can impact society.

* [To build a better ballot](https://ncase.me/ballot/), discussing some of the issues about the *first pass the post *voting system, and how other voting systems are much better for everyone involved (I still think *single transferrable vote* is a no-brainer).

* [The evolution of trust](https://ncase.me/trust/), an interactive game theory simulation, and discussing the impacts on decision-making (especially in war and politics).

* [Wisdom / Madness of Crowds](https://ncase.me/crowds/), about how the internet is affecting opinions and public intelligence.

This is a lot of links, but I honestly believe each is well worth the time to explore, and can also teach a lot. I’ve gone back to look at these projects every few months and continue to learn and enjoy playing around with the simulations.

Now for an interesting bit of Canadian history, the [Great Canadian Maple Syrup Heist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Canadian_Maple_Syrup_Heist). Up until recently, the highest value heist/robbery in Canadian history, and in Canadian fashion; a theft of maple syrup. There are lots of great articles and YouTube videos about it, however, I especially found the Netflix episode [The Maple Syrup Heist](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7909196/) in Dirty Money quite fascinating.

[Beatspace](https://bolddunkley.itch.io/beatspace) is an amazing online game, best played with an Xbox controller, where you create a custom synth track by avoiding obstacles in space. Not too much time to play, but it feels like a lot of thought and love was put into the game (especially for something made for a hackathon), and I would definitely recommend checking it out.

Lastly, Microsoft has gotten on my nerves a bit this week… a few times when I’ve opened my classic Windows Mail app, it’s redirected me to Outlook, and the former is expected to be removed by the end of the year. I understand product depreciation, especially when a replacement is available, but it needs to be way more customizable and functional and allow a smooth transition from the predecessors.

A good example of this is Microsoft Edge, which basically beats out IE in every manner, and retains all functionality and then some, with a customizable UI. It is reasonable to expect all users to *want* to transition, and hence not much worry about removing support for IE.

However, Outlook doesn’t have the same set of functionality as Mail, and has lots of downsides too. Forcing users off a platform should be an upgrade, and an obvious one at that, but it doesn’t feel like that at all.

[This story on PCWorld](https://www.pcworld.com/article/606623/the-best-email-client-for-you-may-be-mail-not-outlook.html) articulates my thoughts well.

One feature that is missing that really bugs me, is that an account can’t be solely used for calendar and not mail. This was a feature in the old Windows Mail and Windows Calendar apps, and it is now not possible.

I’ll stop ranting, but if a company as large as Microsoft decides to deprecate services in favor of others, they should be making sure functionality doesn’t get lost. The consequence of this is, users like myself will certainly be moving to another platform, which I’m doing now. [Mailbird](https://www.getmailbird.com/) and [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-GB/) are good alternatives that come to mind, however, I’ll have to see about their free versions (as I’m currently on a free trial of the premium versions).

Lastly, living away from home means lots of FaceTime-ing with family… so Bo Burnham’s [FaceTime with My Mom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChgFo74WxZ8) really resonated.

All the best,
Owen
