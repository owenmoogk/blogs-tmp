## Leroy², Solar Eclipse Photography, and some neat Data Visualization

Hello! I’ve been busy this week (took a vacation over the long weekend, and school is ramping up), but I’m back with some interesting internet bits.

One of my friends keeps making fun of me for speaking “Canadian” (think Letterkenny hick mixed with hockey slang and a lot of long vowels). I think I’ve picked it up living in Alberta over the winter, and I feel it’s just a fun way to speak. Apparently, it sounds very similar to the TikToker [Leroy and Leroy](https://www.tiktok.com/@leroyandleroy?lang=en).

After going down that particular humorous rabbit hole, here are a few of my favorites:

* [This Old Rink Has A Drawbridge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pmO0JZyrFY) is a long-form piece about an old-school rink in Saskatchewan, with ice entry on stairs, and a neat-looking Zamboni!

* [Leroy and Leroy’s Guide to Saskatoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KiO5hAmhi0), for tips when visiting the “bridge city”.

* And the [Best of Saskatchewan compilation](https://www.tiktok.com/@leroyandleroy/video/7364099534462438662?_r=1&_t=8mA41fM4iTA).

Destin Sandlin has another amazing video (shocker… I know) about [capturing the Solar Eclipse on film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQF51mqzrY4). I always love his videos for the wholesome, scientific content, and this newest video definitely isn’t a letdown.

Also, I like his phrase “Interested people are interesting”. I’ve found this to be true across the board, as someone who has a true passion for almost anything is interesting to talk to and learn from.

Lastly, I’ve come across this visualization for the [most common pin codes](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/most-common-pin-codes/) on the website [Information is Beautiful](https://informationisbeautiful.net/). There’s some neat patterns to pick out, including birthdays, repeated numbers, years, and a few specific memorable patterns.

This is also a clever way of delivering this data that I don’t think I would have thought about. Often communication in science and research is difficult, as with a large number of data points and different relationships, it can be hard to paint a good picture to the average person, and this does an exceptionally good job (even if the data itself is rather useless).

Lastly, I was having breakfast with a few friends, and for whatever reason graph theory came up… who knew [a graph could have ***INFINITE GIRTH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girth_(graph_theory))** *(how can I compete with that?!)

All the best :)
