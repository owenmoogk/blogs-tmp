## Smarter Every Day, Skateboarding, and Felt Art

These last few weeks I’ve been busy traveling (moving home from Alberta), so I haven’t been able to write as much as normal. That being said, now that I’m done working, I have much more time to find cool inspiration on the internet!

First off, Smarter Every Day is an awesome channel. I remember a few years ago when I stumbled onto Destin Sandlin’s content and was unsure if I liked it (probably due to the lack of clickbait), but he is a great engineer and critical thinker, and is so much fun to watch geek out over rockets, cars, and any other science/engineering topics. I love how wholesome his content is, and how almost every topic is truly fascinating.

He recently released an hour-ish-long video, containing [a talk he presented to NASA execs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoJsPvmFixU). He addressed many engineering problems, most of which include critical thinking and communication. He very cleverly and humorously discusses real issues, and how decisions should (and shouldn’t be made). Strongly recommend watching it (even though it’s an hour long).

I’ve been getting more into arts and crafts lately (and by getting into… I mean watching more videos about it), and came across this [craft felt animation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBoQARCkv4Q). First of, it’s really neat from an artistic perspective, but what resonates with me more is the planning and effort that goes into the short, 10 second, video. Frankly, the organization put into this project, making sure every detail was accounted for and ensuring proper planning, was much more than that at my previous company. It’s amazing to see how proper planning and organization from the start of a project can create such a success, which for me translates directly onto any engineering problem.

[Kasso](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZANKhLpONY) is an interesting skateboarding show, and I found these highlights pretty entertaining!

And, a [super unlikely Splash Hit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD02ALCYnH4)!

All the best,
Owen
