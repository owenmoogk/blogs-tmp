## Project Inspiration, Cryptography, and Minecraft Java(script)

This week on the internet...

I’ve re-stumbled upon [How To Mechatronics](https://howtomechatronics.com/category/projects/), a website / YouTube channel for project ideas and tutorials. There are some neat resources about how to build a custom servo, make your own gearbox, and many other parts that are typically only off the shelf. In addition to that, he has many full-scale projects, including pen plotters and RC airplanes.

Although the design is sometimes the most rewarding part of a project, it’s amazing to see a place with so many high-quality projects compiled, with detailed build instructions and parts lists, great for beginner makers.

[The Unbreakable Kryptos Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVpsLMCIB0Y) by Lemmino is a neat short-form documentary about an NSA cryptography problem, containing some incredible details of intelligent crypto-cracking. I find it interesting how the creator of the puzzle says it wasn’t solved the way it was intended, which intrigued me about modern cracking techniques. With computers, many problems were solved by brute force, or semi-smart algorithms, which is incredibly impressive. It amazed me how they could solve the first three parts, likely without using some of the clue’s that the author had intended.

[Lemmino](https://www.youtube.com/@LEMMiNO) also has some great videos about [Cicada 3301](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2O7blSSzpI&t=2s), [D.B. Cooper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbUjuwhQPKs&t=353s), and [the Kennedy Assassination](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u7euN1HTuU).

Lastly, [Minecraft in a browser](https://eaglercraft.com/mc/1.8.8/)..? I think this is illegal, but what an incredible technical problem. Being able to convert something written in Java to JavaScript is an incredible achievement, no less having it running and functioning. I’m sure the number of high school kids playing this on Chromebooks is not small.

Also, [SimCity](https://www.retrogames.cz/play_472-SNES.php) on the SNES will never not be nostalgic.

All the best,
Owen
