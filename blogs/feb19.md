## Blogging… The early 2000s, decentralized, RSS baby.

In the last few years, I’ve fazed out of using common social media. Instagram is “poison”, causing more mental health issues in the current generation than anything ever before, and Facebook is a common time waster in even the middle-aged and ‘boomer’ generations.

Even Snapchat has released its [More Snapchat](https://www.moresnapchat.com/) campaign, which, somewhat hypocritically, points out many of the issues in commonplace social media.

Since making this switch, I’ve found an immense amount of articles, and just “cool internet things” on blogs, personal websites, and other random places that have amazing stories and great teachings.

It’s incredible, as most of the stories I read are from over 10 years ago, and provide an amazing snapshot of a different time on the internet, where RSS was king and where big companies were just starting to figure out the profitability of hosting user data and information. Stories of the [rise of GitHub](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/10/18/optimize-for-happiness), how YouTube engineers [plotted to kill IE6](https://blog.chriszacharias.com/a-conspiracy-to-kill-ie6), and much more.

My blogs aren’t going to be ‘me me me’ blogs. I don’t know much, no sense talking about that. I just want a place for the amazing things that are lost to the internet, to the algorithms that shove content down your throat.

I must admit, the [Tom Scott Newsletter](https://www.tomscott.com/newsletter/) is very much the inspiration for this, as he has some incredible finds that are amazing to read about, and I want to keep my own record of “neat things on the internet”, that I can’t keep in a YouTube ‘liked’ folder.

I hope someone enjoys this little niche of content (even if that someone is just me), and more to come!

All the best,
— Owen
