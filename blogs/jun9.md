## Retro Beats, Analog Map Clocks, and World Perception

This week, I’ve been keeping busy! I learned to charcoal barbeque burgers for the first time (Dad helped a lot, so it wasn’t so hard)! I always love improving my cooking skills, so it was fun (and I got to share them with friends)! Also, I’ve gotten back out on the tennis court! My knee is still a bit shaky from a Spikeball injury a few weeks ago, but it’s awesome to get outside now that the weather is nice. Sometimes it can be easy to just let the summer go to waste, so I’m pretty pleased that I’ve been keeping busy and having lots of fun outside!

Also, I’ve been listening to a new song and can’t encapsulate why I like it so much: [Stolen Dance by Milky Chance](https://open.spotify.com/track/0ZfByLXCeKchuj7zi1CJ0S?si=fbbae0eda3574caa). I don’t know enough about music, but it sounds like the chords don’t quite follow the normal pop-style progression (it’s a bit flat), and it gives a really upset/grunge, however romantic feeling.

I’ve also found some interesting bits on the internet this week. First, [Sean Halpin](https://www.seanhalpin.xyz/) is a web designer who I’ve looked to in the past for design ideas and inspiration. Although I’ve diverged from his style in the past few years, some of his projects are still amazing. Specifically, [Code with me, if you want to live](https://www.codewithme.app/) is a web app that I love to have in the background when I’m doing homework, reading, etc. It’s nothing super complicated but has some great graphics and retro/post-apocalyptic music.

I’ve also been inspired by him to add integrations from Spotify/Soundcloud into my website. He has an “on repeat” section on his website, that I assume pulls from the Spotify API, and the aforementioned app uses Soundcloud. It’s a really nice touch, and I’d love it because I’m into so many different genres of music.

Attoparsec has a great [video about an analog clock/map](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2EUPDSabY0&t=1s), popular in airport displays. It fascinates me how something so sophisticated was designed, built, and able to function so many years later. Especially when the cycle time of the clock is an entire year, testing must have been a nightmare.

I’m not sure how accurate the ‘waves’ are that model the light/dark in different types of the year, but if it’s accurate there must be some intense math that goes into it. Regardless of accuracy, I know that I wouldn’t have thought of blanking out part of the map in that way.

I’m never been super interested in maps, however after seeing this I want to build one for myself. Maybe I can get a collection going, or combine this with a [Jordan Studdard-inspired map](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKEkBgPU-1M).

[This video by Howtown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJXG-5mZfJM&t=3s) discusses how dogs see the world. To me, and probably most people, it’s a question of light spectrums and reception. While that’s a large part of the video and can lead to a decent simulation of what a dog may perceive, the tangent at the end is what I found most interesting.

Using a brain imaging technique, the smell/nose receptors also are ‘wired’ to the vision and optical processing part of the brain, the “occipital lobe”. This means that, in theory, the ‘image’ that a dog sees has a large incorporation of smell.

We are typically pretty locked down to our own world view, whether that be politically or culturally, and don’t often think of how others see the world. It’s perplexing to think that with dogs, just as with other people, although we live in the same reality our perceptions can be incredibly different.

On the subject of dogs… it’s a good thing [wikiHow has a tutorial on how to pet them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ9rLkAiHi8).

All the best,
Owen
