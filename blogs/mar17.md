## Sudoku, a Secret Garage, and new Piano Music

Nothing crazy new… just some interesting things I’ve found on the internet over the last few weeks:

First: Some [hidden patterns in Sudoku](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pezlnN4X52g) that I had no idea about! This is the first video in a two-part series, which discusses some mathematical ideas/proofs that prove some crazy complex patterns in sudokus. The second video even has outlines of seemingly random boxes and uses the completion of the squares to relate them together. Highly recommend a watch for anyone into mathematics or the Sunday Paper game.

Second: [Colin Furze’s secret garage project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWNAf7yuRDQ). DIY videos on the internet are always impressive, however this seems to take it a step further, and do something that I would be impressed for a company and team of people to pull off. Without spoiling the video, there’s some crazy engineering and a special car garage in this multi-part youtube series.

Lastly, I’ve been playing a bit more piano this week! It’s been a few weeks since I’ve sat down, but always enjoy it. I’ve recently learned [Lover by Taylor Swift](https://open.spotify.com/track/1dGr1c8CrMLDpV6mPbImSI?si=d0915cfd23984f22), [Chills by Down With Webster](https://open.spotify.com/track/0BtWu5QzPWkFMP2RPSoUfr?si=3472269ed6514366), and I’m hopeful to learn [All of Me by Jon Schmidt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fAZIQ-vpdw), however, that one will definitely take a while.

I’ll end off with a good [Full Bridge Rectifier video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dtPEk73X9U) (“That’s right, it’s not a dumb, single diode rectifier”)… for all the electrical engineers reading this.

Cheers,
Owen
