## A Map of Wikipedia, Travelling Flames, and a Public Transport Visualization

This week, I’ve discovered a few neat things on the internet…

First, a [Graph of Wikipedia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JheGL6uSF-4). This video makes some interesting connections between culture and the current state of Wikipedia, analyzing links between pages, and how it associates with popularity. Also, there’s lots of interesting graphing terminology, and amazing data science that goes into this, which made it doubly interesting for me.

Second, [A Travelling Flame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqhXQUzVMlQ) (using lighter fluid). This was an interesting discovery, which discusses how complex systems can emerge through relatively simple rules and behaviors. One good example of this is forest fires, but also reminded me of Conway’s Game of Life, which [I have previously written code for](https://owenmoogk.github.io/game-of-life/).

Lastly, [Time2Reach](https://map.henryn.ca/) is an interactive graphing of public transport travel times and has lots of data science/mapping tech going on in the background. I’m looking forward to reading through the GitHub to see exactly how this was done. Also, this illustrates the issue that I and many others have with public transport, that it’s not even close to direct to many less popular places. For example, it can be seen on the map below how it is quicker to travel to Weston than to Davenport from downtown Toronto, even though it’s almost twice the distance away.

That’s all for this week, but more to come!

All the best,
