## Fire Codes, Minecraft Engineering, Carbon Dating, and “The Ukraine”

Hey! I’ve been not busy this last week, but still haven’t managed to do much. I guess I’ll call it recovering from midterms… Anyway, I still haven’t forgotten about the blog!

An artist I’ve been listening to a lot this week is [Dominic Fike](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6USv9qhCn6zfxlBQIYJ9qs?si=zTQIYV_zRkm-QWBkN5UmgQ). I’ve been listening to him for a few years, and have grown more fond of his music recently. He definitely falls into the indie / alternative genre, and some of his songs are so odd… despite how good they are. The only thing I dislike about his music is that you can’t really listen to it with friends, it’s not easy listening (and probably comes with some judgment). Also, it’s interesting how a bunch of his songs are under 2 minutes long, where there’s no repetition of a chorus or bridge. I think this leaves many more doors open for creativity, which he makes use of really well. My top few:

* [Phone Numbers](https://open.spotify.com/track/3f9Mzvd3URfbbIJBX4pz9Z?si=494d9c6a2c4e4b87)

* [Babydoll](https://open.spotify.com/track/7yNf9YjeO5JXUE3JEBgnYc?si=2c33fb44d2744676)

* [Hey Blondie](https://open.spotify.com/track/0hABacr1yTSleOlPKpIWBb?si=6d9ac6dd2fc64a92) (from the Barbie Album)

* And a new one: [misses](https://open.spotify.com/track/6WTFHKrnZpwEBLRS10Ylqs?si=2eefab10bb444eb4)

I haven’t played Minecraft in a while. However, the technical community always has a way of bringing me back in. Recently, I came across CubicMetre’s video about a [Universal Crafting System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ec0o1ncm_fM\), and it’s quite something. Minecraft gives an amazing sandbox for an engineering mindset; create modular components with input/output functionality, and combine ideas to make something that is useful to a player/server.

CubicMetre does a good job explaining his thought process, how he goes about a design, and how he improves on an existing design to make it better. Some of the ideas he comes up with in this video, I don’t think I would have ever thought of. A comment on the video encapsulates my feelings: “The only reason we don’t have fusion reactors yet: the engineers who could have pulled it off are too busy playing Minecraft”.

I would highly recommend this video solely for the design process, and CubicMetre’s channel for anyone into the game.

Tom Lum has a great video about [Carbon Dating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XN758QmTus0). He explains radiation and half-life in a way that’s clearer than any other way I’ve heard. Also, I’m a bit ashamed to admit that I didn’t even know what carbon dating was up until now, I thought it was a type of bonding that Carbon atoms went through (like dating, as in joining).

Some of the cutaway gags are a bit much for me, but overall it’s really educational and informative, and explained something I had no idea about in quite a presentable manner.

DeviantOllam has a [2-hour-long video about fire codes and pen-testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtHpiNBzPsk), which I now learned is also called “red-teaming”. First off, to have a job description of “I get paid to break into places” is awesome. It sounds like an amazing gig that you can have a lot of fun with, pretending to be someone else and breaking into a huge corporation. If it wasn’t illegal, I’d be trying this just for fun!

I never thought I’d find myself enjoying a lecture like this, but it makes me think back to a quote from the channel Smarter Every Day: “Interested people are interesting”. It’s clear the whole room is loving the talk, and having a great time learning and discussing different cover stories and technical regulations. It’s people like this who can get newcomers into an industry, because they’re fascinating to listen to and their excitement about a topic is absolutely contagious.

A long time ago (when I was in high school), I was having a conversation with a Russian friend about why the country Ukraine is often called “the Ukraine”. Just today, he sent me [a Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistory/comments/17pclif/why_do_some_countries_have_the_in_front_of_their/) discussing this, and I also found [this BBC Article](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-18233844). It turns out that some countries use the “the” prefix for plurals (ie. “the United States” because there are many states, or “The Bahamas” because there are many islands). Other countries use “the” for specification (ie. “The Congo” because “Congo” could also refer to a river).

However, the only two exceptions I could find are “the Ukraine” and “the Netherlands”, because they translate to “borderlands” and “lowlands” respectively. Because these need a definite article, we choose to add “the” in front (you don’t say “I’m going to lowlands”, you say “I’m going to *the *lowlands”).

And there's another layer! Because Ukraine is now sovereign from Russia (at least according to most countries), people have generally switched from calling it “the Ukraine” to just “Ukraine”, because referring to it as “the borderlands” can disregard this and imply it’s a part of Russia.

It’s fascinating how it once went against how most countries refer to themselves, for grammatical reasons, but has again switched for now political reasons. To me, it’s an interesting bit of history that combines grammar with politics, and shows how even mundane details can hint at historical events!

Most Breaking Bad fans will know of the song [TV On The Radio by DLZ](https://open.spotify.com/track/6La3P2zp9KaW1d35hwm0Xh?si=4a2d299d2d5b4bd5). However, [the live version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WGyq7mUZA0) blew me away! Tunde Adebimpe (the singer) really goes all out… this is why live music is awesome!

That’s all for this week!

All the best,
Owen
