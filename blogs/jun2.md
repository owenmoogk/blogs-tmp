## Optical Science, Precision Actuators, and a Bad UI Design

Hey there! This week, I’ve found some interesting bits on the internet, and pun that I’m probably finding a bit too funny.

First, Steve Mould has an [interesting video about sodium lights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o8ktldjcog) (old school, yellow-ish street lights). I generally feel like I have a decent grasp of optics (how different materials can absorb and emit different wavelengths), but I still wouldn’t’ve expected this result. Without spoiling it… a flame can absorb light, and then emit it in different directions, causing a ‘black-flame’ effect, which is quite mesmerizing.

I was also watching his video about [2D water magic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiDHFg68BR0). Most of it is fairly straightforward physics, but I love looking at all of the neutrally buoyant bees in the water, and seeing how (with some visual effect), it can be used to track flow, eddy currents, and surface interactions.

An article from last month about [accidentally running for president](https://uxdesign.cc/how-do-you-accidentally-run-for-president-of-iceland-0d71a4785a1e). In Iceland, a UI mishap caused at least 11 people to enter themselves in the running accidentally! A UI issue like this is something hard to diagnose, especially if the testers are the same people who made the app. I’m sure many things that I’ve made have similar poor design choices. However, it’s clear that there’s a problem, and proves why “call to action” design is important; at the end of the day, people don’t have time to read a whole webpage.

This also has interesting implications, as it’s clear webpage design can manipulate a user's action (the first thought that comes to mind are the ‘accept cookies’ popups, where it is quite easy to hit accept, while it takes a few precise clicks to decline). It’d be interesting to see if this applies to online surveys or petitions, and if any research has been done to see if surveyors can influence decisions in this manner.

[Aaed Musa](https://www.youtube.com/@AaedMusa) is a fantastic creator that I’ve been following for a bit now, and I’m honestly surprised I haven’t linked to him here earlier. Recently, he made a [speed reducer using rope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwIBTbumd1Q), and in the past has also built an incredible [Rubik’s cube solver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0bMMALYMYk). He’s lesser known, but I love his videos as he explains the concepts and math very well, and he’s also an engineering student like me! It’s inspiring to see how with a 3D printer and a bit of money, all the amazing things you can build.

Lastly, I was at the Blue Jays game yesterday, and there was a pretty humourous interpretation of a Technotronic song (this might be my dad joke side kicking in, but hey)… so here is the [most similar I could find on the internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIr_lD3l9Fg).

All the best!
