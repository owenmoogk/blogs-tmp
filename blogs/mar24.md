## Hexaflexagons, Formula 1, and new Makers

This week on the internet…

[Hexaflexagons by Vihart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIVIegSt81k). This is a cute 3 part series, with some nice storytelling about mathematics history, and a cool paper toy. Also, telling stories through hand-drawn pictures and art is something that won’t get old for me (even if it’s just nostalgia).

Anyone who knows me is aware of my following of Formula 1, however many of my friends have called it ‘boring’. I often find I have a hard time explaining what I find so fascinating, however, I came across a YouTube video this week that captures it almost perfectly. [Formula 1 cars, explained for rookies by Cleo Abram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJgdOMXhEj0) encapsulates my love for the sport in almost its entirety, and is worth a watch for any technology enthusiasts who are also sports fans.

I also love learning about new makers on the internet, or anyone building technology just because you can. [Making the Ultimate Cooking Robot by Gregulations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMoHLUd81P8) was one of the most in-depth hobby projects I’ve seen in a while. Most projects on the internet I feel I can accomplish with some time and effort, however this looks more like an industrial project than a YouTube video.

Another maker channel that I’ve come across has been [Lucas Deem](https://www.youtube.com/@LukasDeem/videos). I enjoy the idea of a “project in a day”, which reminds me of many hackathon projects from back in high school, and I’d love to give that a go again. Also, owning a Honda CR-V, I might have to try out that camper modification too…

Lastly, this week’s [Red Bull Comedy Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZgrOx5j5DI), for your viewing pleasure.

All the best,
Owen
