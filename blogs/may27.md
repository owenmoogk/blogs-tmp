## Internet Confusion, Mathematical Proofs, and a Car Swing

Hello, internet…

This week I’ve been golfing a lot, getting back to the gym, getting together with family, and also enjoying some F1 racing in the form of the Monaco Grand Prix (a fairly boring race, but a wholesome result).

I’ve still made time for some interesting content, so… this week on the internet:

First, Matt Parker on Stand-up Maths has an interesting video about [an unintuitive-at-first proof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhJN9sByRS0). He describes math proofs well, “take something that exists and throw it at the problem”. This generally works well and is something that I’ve had first-hand experience with in my Linear Algebra and Calculus classes. However, thinking about the problem in a different numerical base makes it immediately clear, but it’s something that not many people would consider.

In my opinion, this is what makes mathematics interesting, there are so many problems that can be solved in different ways, and some solutions, even when not applicable, are very elegant.

Also, it alludes to how people can be very biased about how we set our ways. Because everything we use is in base 10, it is simple to prove for all numbers that are powers of 10. However, switching bases is something that is rarely done, just because of convention. It strongly reminds me of [Tom Scott’s pronoun video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46ehrFk-gLk), discussing how pronouns of objects can influence people’s opinions on them. The lesson; it’s good to think outside the box and question why convention is so.

[An interesting car swing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juFKmi59Kn8). This reminds me of some of Colin Furze’s creations, however is actually powered by the wheels of the car. This definitely would take a lot of maths to get everything correct, and get the car to contact the surface without crashing. It actually took me a bit of time to figure out how it was working, and as soon as I did I realized how impressive it was.

Tom Scott has been off the internet for a while, however I’ve re-stumbled upon [this video about WhatsApp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CINVwWHlzTY). It takes a look at some problems with encryption, and backdoors in widely used technologies.

Aside from the politics, I think this is an excellent example of a persuasive video. Tom speaks very confidently when stating both facts and opinions, gives a ton of supporting evidence, and when addressing a counterpoint he states outright “This is my opinion, not a fact”, which greatly increases his credibility.

However, tech regulation is becoming an even larger subject, especially with generative AI ([even Google is suggesting glue for dinner](https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24162896/google-ai-overview-hallucinations-glue-in-pizza)). As the impacts of technology continue to grow, moderation and some form of regulation are likely needed. The question is, who will make these decisions? On an unrelated note…

That’s all folks!
