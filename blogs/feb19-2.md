## Blame vs Solutions; how some problems can only be solved without consequences.

This past week, I’ve come across two articles that resonated with me, both discussing major mishaps in industry that had colossal impacts. However, the kicker, is that nobody was punished for either… and maybe that’s how it should be.

First: [**Why You’ve Never Been In A Plane Crash **by Kyra Dempsey](https://asteriskmag.com/issues/05/why-you-ve-never-been-in-a-plane-crash).
This is an amazing article discussing the culture around airplane crash investigations, and how problems often stem from a place of protocol and not an individual’s mistake.

Second: [**The $500 million dollar typo **by Michelle Gienow](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/true-tales-survival-usps/).
A similar story, of a mistake costing lots of money. When reading this, my instinct told me that the person who made an innocent mistake would be fired, as a scapegoat. However, it was refreshing to see that the actual protocol and mistakes that led up to this moment were analyzed, and improved upon to reduce the chances of it happening again.

In both of these stories, it is clear that most mistakes that happen aren’t caused by one person's misdoing, but instead, by a flurry of bad decisions leading up to it, and looking at the problem as a circumstance instead of a mistake can lead to long-term improvements. The same can’t be said for firing someone in an unfortunate circumstance.

I’ll end by linking to the very relevant: Tom Scott’s [**The Worst Typo I Ever Made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6NJkWbM1xk)**.

Problems are not solved by changing people, they're solved by changing culture.
